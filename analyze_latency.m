% 1. replication of 2p results
% 	1. population average activity for all neurons and ctr-CRF neurons not different between IC and RC across black and white contrasts
% 	2. proportion of IC-encoders and RC-encoders are not significantly different (out of all/visually-responsive neurons and out of ctr-CRF neurons)
% 	3. preferred orientation match between ICs and gratings for IC-encoders and RC-encoders
% 	4. ctrCRF distribution of IC-encoders and RC-encoders are not biased to the illusory region
% 	5. decoder results
% 	6. OSI and iRF
% 2. latency analysis
% 	1. compare latency for ctr-CRF neurons for IC vs REl/REt across visual areas
